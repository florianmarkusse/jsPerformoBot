# jsPerformoBot

Repository for the static-analysis performance bot in JavaScript.

The *out* folder is used for transpilation from ES6 to CJS using Babel to allow GitHub Actions to work as it does not run with ES6.

For manually checking JavaScript files, u can use the command-line interface command "npm run batch $INPUT_DIRECTORY$ $OUTPUT_DIRECTOR$" where it will give u instructions on what to do for batch analysis.
